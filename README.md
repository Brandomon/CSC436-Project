Introduction to your CSC436 Project 
The aim of the project is to apply the concepts discussed in class in a small-scale development 
project. This project simulates a common scenario, where a car manufacturer, Blundai, develops 
safety-critical driver assistance systems for their flagship SUV, the Saint Jose 2.0 4WD Sport. 
Over the next couple weeks, you and your partner(s) will:
  • gain an in-depth understanding of the hardware and software properties of the driver 
    assistance systems;
  • conduct requirements engineering for one of four driver assistance systems:
    o a blind-spot detection system with “safe-exit” feature;
    o a rear-view camera with cross-traffic detection, rear collision avoidance, and 
      smart trunk hatch; 
    o a smart cruise control with forward collision avoidance; and
    o a lane assist system with driver attention warning.
  • conduct safety analyses to ensure that the likelihood of humans and external systems to 
  suffer injury, damage, or death is sufficiently low.
Two homework teams will partner up for the milestones (i.e. 4 students per group). There will be 
a total of three to four milestones.
